A play by mastodon game where you create your own species and wait to know if they survive.

Food chain was originally written by Steve Andrewartha, Steve.Andrewartha@its.utas.edu.au. It was subsequently fixed up quite a bit by Martin Gregory, marting@qpsx.oz.au. Greg Lindahl, lindahl@pbm.com, is the GM of the pbm.com jungles, and rewrote the mail interface to (hopefully) make it a bit more robust.
